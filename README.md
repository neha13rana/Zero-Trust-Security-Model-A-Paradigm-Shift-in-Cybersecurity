# Zero-Trust-Security-Model-A-Paradigm-Shift-in-Cybersecurity

A Review Paper on the topic of Zero Trust Security Model: A Paradigm Shift in Cybersecurity.

**Traditional vs Zero Trust Security Model :**

The traditional perimeter-based network security models are no longer sufficient to combat the growing cybersecurity threats, especially with the integration of cloud computing services and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This integration has created a more diverse network environment with both inside and outside networks, leading to new opportunities for security breaches.

To address these challenges, the concept of Zero Trust Security Architecture has gained interest. Zero Trust challenges the traditional idea of perimeter security by considering no entity inside or outside the network as fundamentally trustworthy. Access to resources is constantly monitored and audited, regardless of the user's location or device. This approach aligns with the evolving threat landscape, where attackers may exploit insider privileges or compromise external credentials to gain network access.

While the significance of Zero Trust is widely acknowledged, there is still a lack of in-depth research on the challenges of implementing Zero Trust Security Architecture, its effectiveness, and its practical applications in various contexts, including cloud and IoT settings. Additionally, there is a knowledge gap regarding the integration of Zero Trust concepts into current infrastructure and their actual execution to combat cybersecurity threats.

This study aims to examine the idea, principles, and implementations of Zero Trust Security Architecture to highlight its importance and potential implications for the academic and business sectors. By identifying significant problems and contributing to the development of Zero Trust, this research aims to facilitate its wider acceptance in future cybersecurity policies.
